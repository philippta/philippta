Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Philipp and I am a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of experience. 
I love working on distributed systems, cloud infrastructure and CLI tooling, while using Go as my programming language of choice.

## Projects

  God is a pretty Go debugger frontend for delve, that
  just gets the job done.

- [Flyscrape](https://github.com/philippta/flyscrape)

  Flyscrape is a modern toolkit for building custom scrapers in
minutes. It combines the powerful networking and concurrency
features of Go with an embedded JavaScript VM for maximum
flexibility.

- [Trip](https://github.com/philippta/trip)

  Trip is a library to elegantly add common features to Go's HTTP client, 
like authenticating requests, automatic retries, header injection or request logging.
It does so by hooking into the client's request transport layer to intercept and adapt any outgoing request.

  Go Web Examples is a collection of code snippets and guides to
teach software engineers the basics of Web Application
Development in Go. It also features a guided video course where we
